This case represents the heating of supercritical methane in an asymmetrically heated channel. 
It is described by the following paper: 

M. Pizzarelli, F. Nasuti, and M. Onofri, Flow Analysis of Transcritical Methane in Rectangular 
Cooling Channels, 44th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference & Exhibit (Hartford,
2008), AIAA 2008-4556, doi:10.2514/6.2008-4556.

Fluid properties were generated with high-accuracy relations; they are located in the constant 
folder.

Case can be executed with ./Allrun
